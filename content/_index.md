This is Florian, welcome to my personal website! I am interested in all things artificial intelligence, but specifically AI for science, including reasoning models, geometric ML and physics-aware deep learning! I am currently a PhD student at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, developing Physics Foundation Models. In my free time, I usually still code, whether its more research or fun projects. I also love to work out, hike and snowboard.This is where I share my work, thoughts, and research. All beliefs are my own, and sometimes they might just be generic ramblings.
