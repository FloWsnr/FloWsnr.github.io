# Building a Personal Website with Hugo

After deciding to create a personal website, I chose Hugo as my static site generator. Here's why and how I built this site.

## Why Hugo?

Hugo offers several advantages:

- **Speed**: Incredibly fast build times
- **Flexibility**: Complete control over themes and layouts
- **No Database**: Everything is in markdown files
- **Built-in Features**: RSS feeds, sitemaps, syntax highlighting

## Project Structure

```
themes/custom/
├── layouts/
│   ├── _default/
│   ├── partials/
│   └── [sections]/
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
└── content/
    ├── blog/
    ├── research/
    ├── projects/
    └── news/
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dark Mode Support

I implemented a theme toggle that:
- Uses CSS custom properties
- Persists preference in localStorage
- Provides smooth transitions

### 2. Image Modal System

All images marked with the `clickable-image` class can be clicked to open in a full-screen modal with alt text display.

### 3. Responsive Design

The site works well on all device sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Content Organization

Each content type has its own archetype and templates:

- **Blog**: Standard blog posts with tags and categories
- **Research**: Academic papers with abstracts and metadata
- **Projects**: Software projects with tech stacks and links
- **News**: Short updates and announcements
- **Hobbies**: Personal interests with images

## What's Next

Future improvements I'm considering:

1. Search functionality
2. Comment system
3. Analytics integration
4. Performance optimizations

The source code for this website is available on my GitHub if you're interested in the implementation details!
