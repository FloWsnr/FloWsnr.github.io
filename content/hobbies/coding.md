I am not only a software developer at work, but also enjoy working on personal projects. You can find some of my more polished projects on my github, but oftentimes I also just play around with new technologies. Here you can see a small animation I created with a custom n-body solver. It shows two suns orbiting around each other, stealing each other's planets. Currently, I put most of my effort into research so the fun projects have to take a backseat.
