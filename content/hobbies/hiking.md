If I find the time, I love to go hiking. Recently, my wife and I visited the US west coast and enjoyed Yosemite National Park (photo) and Zion National Park. We also got to see the gigantic sequoias in the Sierra Nevada mountains as well as the Grand Canyon. Last year, we went to the Alps, specifically the KÃ¶nigssee, which offers breathtaking views of the lake and the surrounding mountains.
During my research stay in Virigina, I also had the chance to explore the Appalachian mountains (Shennandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge mountains). Did you know that these montains are among the oldest in the world? They were formed over 15 million years ago! Thats why they are more rolling hills and less steep climbs like the Alps or the Rockies.
