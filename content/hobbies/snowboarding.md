Most winters, I try to get at least one week of snowboarding in. I'd say I'm an allrounder, enjoying some carving as well as freeriding in powder or some smaller jumps (not very good yet!). With the right people, snowboarding is one of my favorite activities. Here, you can see me enjoying the slopes of Kleinwalsertal while a good friend of mine is recording. As a teenager, I really practiced jumping and fun park stuff, but I got really rusty. I am planning on buying a new board this year and getting back into it.
