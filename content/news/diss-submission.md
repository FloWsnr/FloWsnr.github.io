I have finally submitted my dissertation focused on two-phase flow in porous media and AI foundation models for fluid dynamics.
At RWTH Aachen University, we now need to prepare a completely new topic for the upcoming viva voce examination. This way, we prove we are capable of discussing and defending topics beyond our dissertation work.

I will talk about AI and consciousness, a subject that has fascinated me for a long time. Stay tuned!
