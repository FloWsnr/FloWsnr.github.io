I am excited to announce that I have joined the [TriggerInk project](https://www.dwi.rwth-aachen.de/en/page/triggerink). The project focuses on cartilage tissue engineering using 3D bioprinting techniques. My role involves developing and optimizing the robotic printing processes to create functional cartilage constructs.
The project is a great opportunity to learn more about biotechnology and tissue engineering.
