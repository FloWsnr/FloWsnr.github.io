Inspired by the 3-body problem series on Netflix, I implemented a N-body simulation in C++.
The simulation is rather basic and only uses a simple Euler integration.
Yet, it is still fun to play around with different initial conditions.
In this gif, you can see two suns orbiting around each other, stealing each other's planets.
