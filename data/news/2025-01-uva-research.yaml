  I'm currently conducting research at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, working with
  Stephen Baek's lab on developing a physics foundation model. This exciting project aims to create
  a model that can predict the behavior of multiple physical systems using advanced machine learning techniques.

  The research stay provides an excellent opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in the field
  of AI for science and expand my expertise in physics-informed machine learning.
