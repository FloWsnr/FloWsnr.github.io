  I'm currently conducting research at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, working with
  <a href="https://stephenbaek.github.io/lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Baek's lab</a> on developing a physics foundation model. This exciting project aims to create
  a model that can predict the behavior of multiple physical systems using spatio-temporal attention and a numerical integrator.
  The key point is to leverage in-context learning to enable the model to generalize across different physical domains.
  The research stay also provides an excellent opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in the field
  of AI for science and expand my expertise in physics-informed machine learning.
