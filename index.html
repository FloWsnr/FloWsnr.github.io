            Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, working on
            machine learning and simulation of two-phase flow in porous media. I am interested in all things
            artificial intelligence, but specifically AI for science!

            This is where I share my work, thoughts, and research. Feel free to explore my projects or check out my
            research papers. All beliefs are my own, and somethings they might
            just be generic ramblings.
