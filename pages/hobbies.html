                <p class="hobby-description">
                    If I find the time, I love to go hiking. Recently, my wife and I visited the US west coast and
                    enjoyed Yosemite National Park (photo) and Zion National Park. We also got to see the gigantic
                    sequoias
                    in
                    the Sierra Nevada mountains as well as the Grand Canyon.
                    Last year, we went to the Alps, specifically the KÃ¶nigssee, which offers breathtaking views of the
                    lake
                    and the surrounding mountains.

                <p class="hobby-description">
                    Most winters, I try to get at least one week of snowboarding in.
                    I'd say I'm an allrounder, enjoying some carving as well as freeriding in powder or some smaller
                    jumps. With the right people, snowboarding is one of my favorite activities.
                    Here, you can see me enjoying the slopes of Kleinwalsertal while a good friend of mine is filming
                    me.

                <p class="hobby-description">
                    I am not only a software developer at work, but also enjoy working on personal projects.
                    You can find some of my more polished projects on my github, but oftentimes I also just
                    play around with new technologies. Here you can see a small animation I created with a custom
                    n-body solver. It shows two suns orbiting around each other, stealing each other's planets.
