                    <p class="project-description">
                        During one of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c04641">my papers</a>, we needed to use
                        multiple 3D convolutions to calculate some structural
                        properties of porous media. However, for porous media, only the solid materials are of interest,
                        so we needed to mask the convolutions while keeping a normalization to 1. This can be done with
                        two convolutions divided, see the paper.
                        To practice some CUDA, I now started to implement a masked convolution in CUDA, which should be
                        faster than two cupy convolutions.
                        Since I did not find any GeMM implementation, I started with the crude implementation.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        Inspired by the 3-body problem series on Netflix, I implemented a N-body simulation in C++.
                        The simulation is rather basic and only uses a simple Euler integration. Yet, it is still fun
                        to play around with different initial conditions. In this gif, you can see two suns orbiting
                        around each other, stealing each other's planets.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        This project serves as a boilerplate for training machine learning models. It includes
                        distributed training, logging (WandB), Mixed Precision, and more. The project is designed to be
                        easily extendable, allowing users to add their own datasets and models with minimal effort.
