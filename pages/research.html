                            This conference presentation was a sneak peek into work I am currently doing with Stephan
                            Zimmer.
                            We are using machine learning (XGBoost) to predict the performance of PEM electrolysis
                            reactors. For this we build a database from more than 200 publications, predict cell
                            potentials
                            and calculate metrics such as feature importance.

                            Green Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is paramount in the transition from fossil
                            fuels towards a carbon
                            neutral industry. Hydrogen is expected to function as energy carrier in mobility, energy
                            storage medium in electricity
                            grids and as regenerative fuel in industrial processes such as steel production. Proton
                            exchange membrane water
                            electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out as a promising technology for hydrogen production due to
                            high current densities with
                            high efficiencies and highly dynamic operation. While the number of publications on the
                            production of PEM electrolysers
                            grows steadily, a lack of standardized methodologies and experimental guidelines persists.
                            Many studies focus on
                            specific components and their manufacturing steps, hindering direct comparison and
                            complicating data interpretation.
                            Consequently, standardization of research data and specification of parameters is the
                            objective of the current research
                            landscape.

                            In this work, we systematically analyzed literature and gathered meta data regarding
                            experimental procedures for
                            lab-scale production of PEM electrolysers. Thereby, special attention is on the
                            identification of potential improvement
                            in data management. The production of electrolysers can be divided into the various tasks as
                            the fabrication of membrane
                            electrode assemblies (MEAs), which includes catalyst ink production, coating and assembly,
                            electrolyser design and
                            characterization. All areas are in turn subdivided into metadata, for example the ionomer to
                            catalyst ratio and catalyst
                            content for the catalyst ink, the coating technology such as spray or slot coating for the
                            coating. In total, over 60
                            different parameters were considered and a database with over 600 different samples from
                            publications around the world
                            was created. Incomplete datasets were determined by classification using various methods,
                            such as k-nearest-neighbors.

                            The extensive database was implemented in various machine learning algorithms with the goal
                            of identifying parameters
                            with a significant influence on the target variable based on the polarization curve. We then
                            identify correlations
                            between different parameters and formulate guidelines for individual fabrication steps and
                            materials for electrolyzers.
                            An optimization is then applied to determine the most favorable procedure for MEA
                            fabrication and assembling
                            electrolysers, incorporating all the parameters from the database.

                            This work lays the foundation for future publications regarding the standardization of
                            research data and shows how
                            correlations between different parameters can be identified and optimized with the help of
                            data management.

                            Accurate prediction of water content in fuel cells or electrolyzers is crucial for their
                            performance. We developed a new algorithm which is fast and accurate (enough). I am not sure
                            if this simulation will be used in industry, but it opened up new questions and challenges
                            regarding
                            the role of PTFE and where to place it.

                            Gas diffusion layers (GDLs) are usually coated with a hydrophobic agent to achieve a
                            delicate balance between liquid and
                            gas phases to maximize mass transport. Yet, most GDL numerical models to date have assumed
                            an average contact angle for
                            all materials, thereby eliminating the possibility of studying the role of the
                            polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content.
                            This study introduces two mixed wettability algorithms to predict the mixed wetting behavior
                            of GDLs composed of
                            multiple materials. The algorithms employ contact angle and distance to solid materials to
                            determine the critical
                            capillary pressure for each pore voxel. The application of the algorithms to the estimation
                            of capillary pressure vs
                            saturation curves for two GDLs, namely, a micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) reconstructed SGL
                            39BA GDL and a
                            stochastically reconstructed Toray 120C GDL, showed that, in agreement with experimental
                            data, the addition of PTFE
                            resulted in a decrease in saturation at a given capillary pressure. For Toray-120C, the
                            mixed wettability model was
                            capable of reproducing experimentally observed features in the intrusion curve at low
                            saturation that could not be
                            reproduced with a single wettability model, providing a clear link between PTFE coverage and
                            intrusion at low
                            saturation. Numerical results also predicted an increased breakthrough pressure and a
                            decrease in saturation with
                            increasing PTFE, in agreement with experimental observations. The decreased saturation at
                            breakthrough improves gas
                            transport through the layer while maintaining the layer's ability to remove water.
                            Diffusivity simulations confirm the
                            increase in diffusivity at breakthrough with increasing PTFE, thereby providing a rationale
                            for the addition of PTFE, as
                            well as for the optimal amount. This study emphasizes the importance of multimaterial
                            wetting models and calls for more
                            detailed investigations into PTFE and ionomer distributions in GDLs and catalyst layers,
                            respectively.

                            The use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) enables efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction
                            and may be a viable
                            technology in CO2 utilization after carbon capture. Understanding the spatio-temporal
                            phenomena at the triple-phase
                            boundary formed inside GDEs remains a challenge; yet it is critical to design and optimize
                            industrial electrodes for
                            gas-fed electrolyzers. Thus far, transport and reaction phenomena are not yet fully
                            understood at the microscale, among
                            other factors, due to a lack of experimental analysis methods for porous electrodes under
                            operating conditions. In this
                            work, a realistic microfluidic GDE surrogate is presented. Combined with fluorescence
                            lifetime imaging microscopy
                            (FLIM), the methodology allows monitoring of wetting and local pH, representing the dynamic
                            (in)stability of the triple
                            phase boundary in operando. Upon charging the electrode, immediate wetting leads to an
                            initial flooding of the catalyst
                            layer, followed by spatially oscillating pH changes. The micromodel presented gives an
                            experimental insight into
                            transport phenomena within porous electrodes, which is so far difficult to achieve. The
                            methodology and proof of the
                            spatio-temporal pH and wetting oscillations open new opportunities to further comprehend the
                            relationship between gas

                            During this study, I had access to a metal 3D printer. I used it to create novel electrode
                            designs based on mathematical surfaces called triply periodic minimal surfaces (<a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triply_periodic_minimal_surface">TPMS</a>). Such 3D
                            electrodes can have significantly higher surface area than conventional parallel plate
                            electrodes as well as improved mass transport. Additionally, it is just fun to create
                            crazy-looking metal things!

                            Electrochemical flow reactors facilitate the storage of renewable energies and the
                            carbon-neutral production of platform
                            chemicals. To maximize the reactor efficiency, unhindered mass transport in the flow channel
                            and high surface electrodes
                            is required. However, state-of-the-art reactors are limited by the conventional parallel
                            plate designs. Herein, 3D
                            intertwined electrode pairs are presented, based on triply periodic minimal surfaces that
                            facilitate mass transport and
                            provide high surface areas. Three gyroid designs with outer dimensions of 20 × 40 × 70 mm
                            are manufactured from
                            stainless steel via selective laser melting and implemented into a conventional flow cell.
                            By design, the electrodes are
                            rendered porous through the targeted control of the energy density during fabrication. Mass
                            transport characterization
                            by use of the fast ferri-/ferrocyanide redox reaction demonstrates that smaller unit cells
                            and thus shorter
                            interelectrode distances achieve significantly increased current densities. Moreover, the
                            addition of convective
                            channels formed by second-level gyroid structures removes diffusion boundary layers by
                            promoting convective flow in
                            electrode vicinity. The convective flow enhancement of the microscale channels even
                            surpasses the effect of the unit
                            cell size reduction, demonstrating importance of mass transport control. The integrated
                            electrode design holds great
                            potential for efficient next-generation electrochemical flow reactors.

                            This was my Bachelor thesis. I developed a model (in gProms) for the flow-electrode
                            capacitive deionization
                            (FCDI) process. FCDI is a novel water desalination technology our chair uses to recover
                            lithium from brines (battery waste). The simulation is able to predict the process behavior
                            for a wide range of salinities.

                            Flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) is an electrically driven water desalination
                            technology promising for many
                            applications, such as industrial wastewater treatment. FCDI exploits the pumpability of
                            carbon slurries, enabling a
                            continuous process suitable for a wide range of feed salinities. Previously, we demonstrated
                            the applicability of FCDI
                            processes with incorporated ion-exchange membranes for the desalination and concentration of
                            saline brines containing
                            60–120 g/L NaCl. At such elevated salinities, steep concentration gradients occur across the
                            membranes of an FCDI cell.
                            Hence, the characteristics of the membranes become crucial for the overall process
                            performance. It is not yet fully
                            understood, which physical phenomena dominantly influence the ion transport.
                            In this article, we present the first FCDI process model focusing on brine treatment. While
                            our previously published
                            FCDI model (Rommerskirchen et al., 2018) was suitable for simulating the treatment of low
                            salinity solutions, the model
                            at hand includes more non-idealities and focuses on the ion transport through the
                            ion-exchange membranes. We introduce a
                            constriction factor (sigma-factor) for the diffusion coefficients to model the electrical
                            double layer behavior within
                            the membranes at steep concentration gradients. Hence, the model is now also suitable for
                            the simulation of continuous
                            FCDI processes for brine treatment and shows good correlation with experimental results.
