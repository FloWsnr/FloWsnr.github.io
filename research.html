                        Gas diffusion layers (GDLs) are usually coated with a hydrophobic agent to achieve a delicate
                        balance between liquid and
                        gas phases to maximize mass transport. Yet, most GDL numerical models to date have assumed an
                        average contact angle for
                        all materials, thereby eliminating the possibility of studying the role of the
                        polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content.
                        This study introduces two mixed wettability algorithms to predict the mixed wetting behavior of
                        GDLs composed of
                        multiple materials. The algorithms employ contact angle and distance to solid materials to
                        determine the critical
                        capillary pressure for each pore voxel. The application of the algorithms to the estimation of
                        capillary pressure vs
                        saturation curves for two GDLs, namely, a micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) reconstructed SGL
                        39BA GDL and a
                        stochastically reconstructed Toray 120C GDL, showed that, in agreement with experimental data,
                        the addition of PTFE
                        resulted in a decrease in saturation at a given capillary pressure. For Toray-120C, the mixed
                        wettability model was
                        capable of reproducing experimentally observed features in the intrusion curve at low saturation
                        that could not be
                        reproduced with a single wettability model, providing a clear link between PTFE coverage and
                        intrusion at low
                        saturation. Numerical results also predicted an increased breakthrough pressure and a decrease
                        in saturation with
                        increasing PTFE, in agreement with experimental observations. The decreased saturation at
                        breakthrough improves gas
                        transport through the layer while maintaining the layer’s ability to remove water. Diffusivity
                        simulations confirm the
                        increase in diffusivity at breakthrough with increasing PTFE, thereby providing a rationale for
                        the addition of PTFE, as
                        well as for the optimal amount. This study emphasizes the importance of multimaterial wetting
                        models and calls for more
                        detailed investigations into PTFE and ionomer distributions in GDLs and catalyst layers,
                        respectively.

                        The use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) enables efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction and
                        may be a viable
                        technology in CO2 utilization after carbon capture. Understanding the spatio-temporal phenomena
                        at the triple-phase
                        boundary formed inside GDEs remains a challenge; yet it is critical to design and optimize
                        industrial electrodes for
                        gas-fed electrolyzers. Thus far, transport and reaction phenomena are not yet fully understood
                        at the microscale, among
                        other factors, due to a lack of experimental analysis methods for porous electrodes under
                        operating conditions. In this
                        work, a realistic microfluidic GDE surrogate is presented. Combined with fluorescence lifetime
                        imaging microscopy
                        (FLIM), the methodology allows monitoring of wetting and local pH, representing the dynamic
                        (in)stability of the triple
                        phase boundary in operando. Upon charging the electrode, immediate wetting leads to an initial
                        flooding of the catalyst
                        layer, followed by spatially oscillating pH changes. The micromodel presented gives an
                        experimental insight into
                        transport phenomena within porous electrodes, which is so far difficult to achieve. The
                        methodology and proof of the
                        spatio-temporal pH and wetting oscillations open new opportunities to further comprehend the
                        relationship between gas
                        diffusion electrode properties and electrical currents originating at a given surface potential.

                        Electrochemical flow reactors facilitate the storage of renewable energies and the
                        carbon-neutral production of platform
                        chemicals. To maximize the reactor efficiency, unhindered mass transport in the flow channel and
                        high surface electrodes
                        is required. However, state-of-the-art reactors are limited by the conventional parallel plate
                        designs. Herein, 3D
                        intertwined electrode pairs are presented, based on triply periodic minimal surfaces that
                        facilitate mass transport and
                        provide high surface areas. Three gyroid designs with outer dimensions of 20 × 40 × 70 mm are
                        manufactured from
                        stainless steel via selective laser melting and implemented into a conventional flow cell. By
                        design, the electrodes are
                        rendered porous through the targeted control of the energy density during fabrication. Mass
                        transport characterization
                        by use of the fast ferri-/ferrocyanide redox reaction demonstrates that smaller unit cells and
                        thus shorter
                        interelectrode distances achieve significantly increased current densities. Moreover, the
                        addition of convective
                        channels formed by second-level gyroid structures removes diffusion boundary layers by promoting
                        convective flow in
                        electrode vicinity. The convective flow enhancement of the microscale channels even surpasses
                        the effect of the unit
                        cell size reduction, demonstrating importance of mass transport control. The integrated
                        electrode design holds great
                        potential for efficient next-generation electrochemical flow reactors.

                        Flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) is an electrically driven water desalination
                        technology promising for many
                        applications, such as industrial wastewater treatment. FCDI exploits the pumpability of carbon
                        slurries, enabling a
                        continuous process suitable for a wide range of feed salinities. Previously, we demonstrated the
                        applicability of FCDI
                        processes with incorporated ion-exchange membranes for the desalination and concentration of
                        saline brines containing
                        60–120 g/L NaCl. At such elevated salinities, steep concentration gradients occur across the
                        membranes of an FCDI cell.
                        Hence, the characteristics of the membranes become crucial for the overall process performance.
                        It is not yet fully
                        understood, which physical phenomena dominantly influence the ion transport.
                        In this article, we present the first FCDI process model focusing on brine treatment. While our
                        previously published
                        FCDI model (Rommerskirchen et al., 2018) was suitable for simulating the treatment of low
                        salinity solutions, the model
                        at hand includes more non-idealities and focuses on the ion transport through the ion-exchange
                        membranes. We introduce a
                        constriction factor (sigma-factor) for the diffusion coefficients to model the electrical double
                        layer behavior within
                        the membranes at steep concentration gradients. Hence, the model is now also suitable for the
                        simulation of continuous
                        FCDI processes for brine treatment and shows good correlation with experimental results.
